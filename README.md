# ATDP-Application-MOOD-Project

Hello! This is a short project which I created in MOOD (Mobile & Object-Oriented Design). It features a player-controlled black ball which is controlled with WASD (space to de-accelerate). Your objective is to dodge spiked walls (blue), obstacles (purple) and enemy balls (red). If you capture a green lifesaver enemy, you gain a life. If you collect a coin (gold), you gain 1000 points. You get different point values for different mobs going off-screen, and lose points if the player gets damaged. When you lose all lives, the game ends and you are given a final score and a snarky remark (based on your points).

All public methods have java comments for instruction of its usage, so code analysis may be slightly easier.

This program requires JavaFX 14 to render the program.

enjoy!!! :)
